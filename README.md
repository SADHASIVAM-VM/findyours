FindYours – Missing Items Finder Platform
1. Project Overview

FindYours is a community-driven platform designed to help individuals locate lost belongings with the assistance of the public. The system allows users to report missing items or upload details of found items. Through a searchable interface, users can filter items by name, location, and date to improve chances of recovery.

By leveraging crowdsourcing, FindYours creates a collaborative ecosystem where the public helps each other reunite with their valuable possessions.

2. Objectives

Provide a centralized platform for reporting and searching lost/found items.

Utilize public participation to enhance item recovery success rates.

Enable easy search and filter functionality by location, date, and item name.

Ensure secure user access through Firebase authentication.

Deliver a responsive and intuitive MERN-based web application.

3. Key Features
3.1 User Features

User Authentication (Firebase):

Secure sign-up/login via email, Google, or social accounts.

Role-based access (e.g., item reporter vs. general user).

Report Lost/Found Items:

Upload item details (name, description, last seen date, location, image).

Public posting of found items with optional contact details.

Search & Filter:

Search items by keywords (item name, description).

Filter by last location and date range.

Notifications (optional extension):

Alert when items matching user’s lost report are posted.

3.2 Admin Features

Moderate and verify suspicious posts.

Manage inappropriate or duplicate entries.

Analytics dashboard for monitoring user activity.

Post Item → user provides item details + optional image.

Browse/Search Items → by location, date, or name.

Contact Reporter → reach out via app messaging or email (if provided).

Admin Moderation → maintain trust and data integrity.

7. Security Considerations

Firebase Auth ensures secure login and identity management.

JWT tokens for backend API authentication.

Input sanitization to prevent XSS/SQL injection.

Role-based access (admin vs. general users).

Secure file upload with validation (if supporting images).

8. Future Enhancements

Mobile app version (React Native).

Geolocation-based item recommendations.

AI-powered image recognition for matching similar items.

Push notifications for item matches.

Integration with local authorities (e.g., police lost & found).

9. Project Management

Agile Methodology with 2-week sprints.

Tools: Jira / Trello for task tracking, GitHub for version control.

Team Roles:

Frontend Developer

Backend Developer

Database Administrator
